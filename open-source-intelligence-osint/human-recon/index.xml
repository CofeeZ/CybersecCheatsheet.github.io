Socialscan (https://github.com/iojw/socialscan) # Many tools used to check if an account exists comes with false positive # 100% accuracy: Rather than scanning profile pages, socialscan queries the # registration servers of the platforms directly, retrieving the appropriate # CSRF tokens, headers, and cookies. # This eliminates all false positives/negatives, ensuring that results are accurate. # Speed: socialscan uses asyncio along with aiohttp to conduct all # queries concurrently, resulting in very quick searching even with bulk queries.</description>
